  - Black American Contributers is my main header and each page has a header
  - The link to my different pages is a navigation option on every page
  - Each image I have has the alt attribute with the name of who the image is
  - I attempted to add media query to my page by I am still struggling with that component
  - Each of my pages validated with no warnings or errors

  and someone they think should be included on the site
